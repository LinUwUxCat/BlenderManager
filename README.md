# BlenderManager
BlenderManager is a tool allowing you to have different versions of blender installed in one place, as well as download new ones from the official website.
## Known issues
- Symlinks do not copy properly, leading to blender not launching if it has any (this may be a dotnet issue?)
- There is no config so the folder has to be selected every time
